 About
=======

Enable Viacam (a.k.a. eViacam) is a mouse replacement software that moves the 
pointer as you move your head. It works on standard PCs equipped with a web 
camera. No additional hardware is required. Based on the award winning Facial
Mouse software. 

 Supported platforms
=====================

GNU/Linux
Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7

 Instructions 
==============

(NOTE: as of version 1.4, the instructions manual is included in the software)

First install and configure your web camera before using eViacam. It's very important to configure your camera in manual exposure mode and adjust this parameter to get about 25 fps or more. Most modern cameras can deliver 30fps. Please check your web camera manual when necessary.

Once installed run evicam (evicam.exe for Windows). The application should open, automatically detect your camera and begin streaming the live video. 

Place the camera to get a frontal view of your face. The width of your face in the image should be a third of the width of the frame. Centre the tracking box around your face either moving the camera or displacing the on-screen blue box with the mouse (clicking at the corner).

Enable the tracking function from the File menu. Try moving your head and see the result. You should adjust the sensitivity (X and Y axis speed) from the options dialog.  You should be able to reach all the screen area with the mouse pointer.

For clicking simply stop the pointer over the desired position. In few moments a click will be generated automatically (you can adjust the dwell time in the options dialog). You can use the docked window at the top of the screen for selecting the different kinds of clicks.

 Build instructions
====================

See INSTALL file.

 Notes
=======

- Asturian (Bable) support

The current stable version of wxWidgets (2.8.x, June 2012) doesn't support 
Asturian language yet, but it seems that support has been added to development
version. So, if you want enable Asturian language support, you need the latest
wxWidgets development snapshot and should uncomment the line before compiling
	// #define ENABLE_ASTURIAN
in both 
	src/langnames-utf8.h
	src/langnames-utf16.h
