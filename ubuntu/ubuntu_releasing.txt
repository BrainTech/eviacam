Before generating any .deb package make sure file debian/changelog is up
to date. Run the following command and check that contents are correct:

    dch -i

To automatically generate several Ubuntu packages just run (make sure 
debian-src/ directory is void or missing):

	make_ubuntu_release.sh

To upload a package:

	dput eviacam-ppa eviacam_1.5.4-0ubuntu1~lucid_source.changes

Other useful commands:	
	
  * DEB source package generation
      make deb-src
	  
  * .changes file generation
	  Useful when generating packages for several distros. Assumes previous 
	  step has been done. For each distro edit debian/changes with 
	  
        dch -i
      
	  add the right information then run
	  
        make deb-src-changes
		
	  Note that for several distro version the first one needs to be made 
	  using make deb-src so that src is included.
