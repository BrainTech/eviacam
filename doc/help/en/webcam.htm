<h2 class="text">About webcams</h2>

<p class="tnormal">The webcam is a key element for the proper operation of eViacam. To ensure the best user experience, the image provided by the web camera should conform with the following requisites:</p>
<br>

<br>
<p class="tnormal"><strong>CAPTURE SPEED</strong></p>
<br>

<p class="tnormal">This is the number of frames per second (fps) that the webcam sends to the computer. For a smooth operation, the capture speed should be equal or greater than 25 fps. You can check this value at the bottom left corner of the main window of eViacam. For values under 25, the eViacam performance is greatly reduced. Please note that external factors, such as lighting conditions, could reduce the capture speed. If this happends, you may want to adjust the camera settings through the configuration dialogue.</p>

<br>

<br>
<p class="tnormal"><strong>IMAGE QUALITY</strong></p>
<br>

<p class="tnormal">The image quality has a direct impact on the eViacam performance. For better results use high quality cameras with glass lenses and CCD sensors. You might also need to properly set the anti flicker option depending on your local power line frequency (50/60 Hz).</p>
<br>

<br>
<p class="tnormal"><strong>IMAGE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
<br>

<p class="tnormal">This is the size (in pixels) at which the image is grabbed. eViacam always use a 320x240 resolution.</p>
