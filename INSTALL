This document describes how to compile and install Enable Viacam for
GNU/Linux and Windows platforms.

Linux
=====

  --------------
  wxWidgets >= 2.6
  opencv >= 1.0
  gtk+-2.0
  libxtst
  libxext 

  Ubuntu notes: in order to compile on Ubuntu (karmic) and GGv6 you 
  need the following packages: libxext-dev, libxtst-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, 
  libwxbase2.8-dev, libwxgtk2.8-dev, libhighgui-dev, libswscale-dev
  
- Generic compilation and installation
  ------------------------------------
  ./configure
  make 
  make install

  -------------
  
  Before generating any .deb package make sure file debian/changelog is up
  to date. Run the following command and check that contents are correct:
    dhc -i

  * DEB source package generation
      ./configure
      make deb-src
	  
  * changes file generation
      Useful when generating packages for several distros. Assumes previous 
	  step has been done. For each distro edit debian/changes with 
		dch -i
      add the right information then run
	    make deb-src-changes
	  
  * DEB binary package generation
      ./configure
      make deb
	  
    Old way:
      1.- Ensure that config.status doesn't exists (i.e. make distclean)
      2.- Run: fakeroot debian/rules binary
      3.- Clean tree:fakeroot debian/rules clean
