Comment:
 NOTE: this version of pwc is an unofficial (modified) release of pwc & pcwx
 driver and thus may have bugs that are not present in the original version.
 Please send bug reports and support requests to <luc@saillard.org>.
 The decompression routines have been implemented by reverse-engineering the
 Nemosoft binary pwcx module. Caveat emptor.
