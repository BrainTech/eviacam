_Description: Should eviacamloader be installed 'setuid root'?
 In order to enable ordinary users to run eviacam in high priority
 (which improves responsiveness), the eviacamloader program can be 
 installed with the set-user-ID bit set, so that it will run with 
 the permissions of the superuser.
 .
 Such a setting may have security implications in the case of
 vulnerabilities in eviacamloader's code.
